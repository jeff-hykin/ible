It is increasingly common for researchers to need to add annotated timestamps to videos. For regular data many proprietary cloud solutions exist. However, for data that cannot leave a local network, spreadsheets are often used to manually track timestamps due to a lack of viable alternatives. Here we present Ible, a tool that has been used at Texas A&M to create tens of thousands of timestamps by over 25 graduate students for both coursework and research projects. Ible is an easy-setup high-throughput cross-platform graphical tool for fast timestamp generation, verification, and analysis.
