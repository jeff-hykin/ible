It is time consuming and increasingly common for researchers and information workers to need to collaboratively add annotated timestamps to videos. For regular data many proprietary cloud solutions exist. However, for data that cannot leave a local network, spreadsheets are often used to manually track timestamps due to a lack of viable alternatives. Here we present Ible, a tool that has been used at Texas A&M to create tens of thousands of timestamps by over 25 graduate students for both coursework and research projects. Ible is a low-commitment high-throughput tool cross-platform graphical tool for fast timestamp generation, verification, and analysis.
