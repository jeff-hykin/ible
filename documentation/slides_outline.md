"What are you trying to do?"

    - You are a researcher
    - You've got 35Gb of raw confidential video footage
    - You need your definitely-not sleep deprived ~~underlings~~ to mark important timestamps
    - You need to be able to quickly verify they didn't accidentally mark something wrong
    - And you need download everything as a spreadsheet that is simple enough that a grad student who has been awake for 48 hours can still understand the format. (Hypothetically of course)
    

"How is it done today"
"What limitations are being addressed?"

    - So what tool do you pick for the job?
    - Vidat is great for visual segmentation, but doesn't even allow for timestamped comments.
    - CVAT has more features and support, but on top of a high setup cost, it is also optimized for video segmentation with barely any support for plain timestamps.
    - The manual approach; video player on one side, spreadsheet on the other is a bit like walking through your house blindfolded. Slow, lots of invisible stumbling blocks, but definitely possible.
    
"How does this tool solve the problem?"
    
    - If only there was a cross platform graphical tool
        - That had instant-setup like Vidat
        - Was designed specifically for timestamp creation and verification
        - Was tested on nearly 30 real-life sleep deprived graduate students
        - That also has a short but memorable name like "Ible"
