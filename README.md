iLab Database Interface

# Setup

Everything is detailed in the `documentation/setup.md`!

# Usage

To debug run:

```sh
npm run start
```

And then open then url in the browser ([http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234))


To deploy (slightly better performance) do:

```sh
npm run build
npm run serve
```
