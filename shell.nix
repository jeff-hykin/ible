# 
# how to add packages?
# 
    # you can search for them here: https://search.nixos.org/packages
    # to find them in the commandline use:
    #     nix-env -qP --available PACKAGE_NAME_HERE | cat
    # ex:
    #     nix-env -qP --available opencv
    #
    # NOTE: some things (like setuptools) just don't show up in the 
    # search results for some reason, and you just have to guess and check ðŸ™ƒ
