            #     nix-env -qP --available PACKAGE_NAME_HERE | cat
            # ex:
            #     nix-env -qP --available opencv
            # to add those specific versions find the nixpkgs.STUFF 
            # and add it here^ as normalPackages.STUFF
            # ex find:
            #     nixpkgs.python38Packages.opencv3  opencv-3.4.8
            # ex add:
            #     normalPackages.python38Packages.opencv3
            # 
            # NOTE: some things (like setuptools) just don't show up in the 
            # search results for some reason, and you just have to guess and check ðŸ™ƒ
